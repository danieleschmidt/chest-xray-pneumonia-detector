# GitHub Workflows - Manual Addition Required

Due to GitHub App permission restrictions, the following workflow files need to be added manually by a repository administrator with `workflows` permission:

## üîß Required Workflows

### 1. Comprehensive CI (`ci-comprehensive.yml`)
**Purpose**: Complete CI pipeline with matrix testing, security scanning, and quality checks
**Triggers**: Push to main/develop, pull requests, daily schedule
**Features**:
- Multi-OS testing (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS)
- Python version matrix (3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11)
- Code quality checks (ruff, black, bandit)
- Security scanning (CodeQL, dependency scanning)
- Performance testing
- Container building and scanning
- Documentation validation

### 2. Production Deployment (`cd-production.yml`)
**Purpose**: Automated production deployment pipeline
**Triggers**: Release tags, manual dispatch
**Features**:
- Multi-architecture container builds
- Security scanning with SARIF uploads
- Blue-green deployment support
- SBOM generation
- Production health checks
- Rollback capabilities

### 3. Security Scanning (`security-scan.yml`)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive security analysis
**Triggers**: Push, pull requests, daily schedule
**Features**:
- SAST with Bandit and Semgrep
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Secret scanning with TruffleHog
- Container security scanning with Trivy
- Infrastructure as Code scanning
- License compliance checking

### 4. Dependency Updates (`dependency-updates.yml`)
**Purpose**: Automated dependency management
**Triggers**: Weekly schedule, manual dispatch
**Features**:
- Python dependency updates
- GitHub Actions updates
- Security advisory monitoring
- Docker base image updates
- Automated PR creation with testing

### 5. Release Automation (`release.yml`)
**Purpose**: Complete release pipeline
**Triggers**: Version tags, manual dispatch
**Features**:
- Package building and validation
- Container image publishing
- Security scanning before release
- GitHub release creation
- PyPI publishing
- Staging deployment

### 6. Semantic Release (`semantic-release.yml`)
**Purpose**: Automated versioning and changelog
**Triggers**: Push to main branch
**Features**:
- Conventional commit analysis
- Automated version bumping
- Changelog generation
- Tag creation and release notes

## üìÅ Workflow File Locations

All workflow files should be placed in `.github/workflows/` directory:

```
.github/workflows/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ci-comprehensive.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cd-production.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dependency-updates.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ release.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ semantic-release.yml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ security-scan.yml
```

## üîë Required Secrets

The following secrets need to be configured in the repository settings:

### Required Secrets
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub
- `PYPI_API_TOKEN`: For PyPI package publishing
- `NPM_TOKEN`: For semantic-release (if using npm packages)

### Optional Secrets (for enhanced features)
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`: For notifications
- `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL`: For Microsoft Teams notifications
- `STATUS_API_TOKEN`: For status page updates

## ‚öôÔ∏è Repository Settings

### Required Settings
1. **Actions**: Enable GitHub Actions
2. **Packages**: Enable GitHub Packages (for container registry)
3. **Security**: Enable vulnerability alerts and security updates
4. **Branches**: Set up branch protection rules for `main`

### Recommended Branch Protection Rules
- Require pull request reviews (1+ reviewers)
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date
- Restrict pushes to matching branches
- Require signed commits (optional)

## üöÄ Deployment Environments

Configure the following environments in repository settings:

### Staging Environment
- **Protection rules**: No restrictions
- **Secrets**: Staging-specific configuration
- **Reviewers**: Optional

### Production Environment
- **Protection rules**: Required reviewers
- **Secrets**: Production configuration
- **Reviewers**: Senior team members
- **Wait timer**: Optional delay before deployment

## üìã Post-Setup Checklist

After adding the workflows:

- [ ] Verify all workflows are recognized by GitHub
- [ ] Test CI pipeline with a small change
- [ ] Verify security scanning is working
- [ ] Test release process with a pre-release
- [ ] Configure notification channels
- [ ] Set up monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Train team on new processes

## üîß Customization

The workflow files are designed to be customizable. Common customizations:

1. **Adjust Python versions** in the test matrix
2. **Modify deployment targets** for your infrastructure
3. **Configure notification channels** for your team
4. **Adjust security scanning rules** based on your requirements
5. **Customize release process** for your deployment strategy

## üìö Documentation

Once workflows are added, update the following documentation:
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`: Add workflow information
- `docs/guides/deployment.md`: Update deployment procedures
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Update contribution workflow
- `README.md`: Add CI/CD status badges

## üÜò Support

If you need help with workflow setup:
1. Check GitHub Actions documentation
2. Review the workflow files for inline comments
3. Test workflows in a fork first
4. Create an issue for project-specific questions

**Note**: These workflows represent a production-ready SDLC automation framework. Start with the core workflows (CI and security scanning) and gradually add others based on your team's needs.
