## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Code Review**: All code changes require review before merging
2. **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies up to date
3. **Secret Management**: Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
4. **Input Validation**: Always validate user inputs
5. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest supported version
2. **Secure Configuration**: Follow security configuration guidelines
3. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
4. **Network Security**: Deploy with appropriate network security measures
5. **Access Control**: Implement proper access controls for your deployment

## Security Features

### Built-in Security Measures

1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
2. **Dependency Scanning**: Automated scanning for vulnerable dependencies
3. **Container Security**: Docker images are scanned for vulnerabilities
4. **Static Analysis**: Code is analyzed for security issues using bandit
5. **Secret Scanning**: Automated scanning for accidentally committed secrets

### Security Configuration

#### Environment Variables

```bash
# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=INFO                    # Avoid DEBUG in production
ENABLE_CONSOLE_LOGGING=false     # Disable console logging in production

# API Security (when implemented)
API_KEY_REQUIRED=true            # Require API keys
RATE_LIMITING_ENABLED=true       # Enable rate limiting
CORS_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com  # Restrict CORS origins

# Database Security (when implemented)
DATABASE_SSL_REQUIRED=true       # Require SSL for database connections
DATABASE_ENCRYPT_AT_REST=true    # Enable encryption at rest
```

#### Docker Security

```bash
# Run containers as non-root user
docker run --user 1000:1000 pneumonia-detector

# Use read-only filesystems where possible
docker run --read-only pneumonia-detector

# Limit resources
docker run --memory=2g --cpus=1.0 pneumonia-detector

# Use security profiles
docker run --security-opt=no-new-privileges pneumonia-detector
```

### Network Security

1. **TLS/HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
2. **Network Isolation**: Use proper network segmentation
3. **Firewall Rules**: Implement restrictive firewall rules
4. **VPN Access**: Use VPN for administrative access

## Compliance

### Data Privacy

This application processes medical imaging data. Ensure compliance with:

- **HIPAA** (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
- **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation)
- **Local healthcare data protection regulations**

### Medical Device Regulations

**Important**: This software is for research and educational purposes only. It is not intended for clinical diagnosis or treatment decisions. For any clinical use, ensure compliance with:

- **FDA regulations** (if in the United States)
- **CE marking requirements** (if in the European Union)
- **Local medical device regulations**

### Data Handling Guidelines

1. **Anonymization**: Remove all patient identifiers before processing
2. **Encryption**: Encrypt data in transit and at rest
3. **Access Logging**: Log all access to medical data
4. **Retention Policies**: Implement appropriate data retention policies
5. **Backup Security**: Secure backup procedures and encryption

## Vulnerability Management

### Automated Scanning

We use the following automated security scanning tools:

1. **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
2. **CodeQL**: Static code analysis
3. **Trivy**: Container vulnerability scanning
4. **Bandit**: Python security linting
5. **Safety**: Python dependency vulnerability checking

### Manual Security Reviews

1. **Code Reviews**: All code changes undergo security-focused review
2. **Architecture Reviews**: Regular review of system architecture
3. **Penetration Testing**: Periodic security testing (recommended for production deployments)

## Incident Response

### In Case of a Security Incident

1. **Immediate Response**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Assessment**: Assess the scope and impact
3. **Notification**: Notify relevant stakeholders
4. **Containment**: Implement containment measures
5. **Recovery**: Restore secure operations
6. **Documentation**: Document the incident and lessons learned

### Communication

- **Internal Team**: Immediate notification via secure channels
- **Users**: Notification via security advisories if users are affected
- **Authorities**: Notification to relevant authorities if required by law
