# Code Review

## Engineer Review
- **Static Analysis:** `ruff` reports no issues.
- **Security Scan:** `bandit` found no high or medium severity problems.
- **Tests:** `pytest` passes (4 tests run, 10 skipped due to missing optional dependencies such as TensorFlow and scikit‑learn).
- **Code Quality:**
  - The new `pipeline.py` provides a minimal training CLI and dataclass configuration. It is concise and readable.
  - `data_loader.py` now raises `FileNotFoundError` when directories are missing, improving robustness. However, the script contains extensive demo code under `if __name__ == "__main__":` which bloats the module. Consider moving demo utilities to dedicated test helpers or examples.
  - `pyproject.toml` lists standalone modules via `py-modules`; this ensures they are packaged, but the file lacks metadata such as description or dependencies.

## Product Manager Review
- The sprint board shows all tasks marked **Done**, and the tests implemented in `tests/` confirm each acceptance criterion in `tests/sprint_acceptance_criteria.json`.
- Integration tests run the training CLI on dummy data and verify the inference CLI handles non‑image files without crashing.
- Unit tests cover data loading success and failure cases, as well as model creation and validation of bad configurations.
- Lint and security scan tests ensure `ruff` and `bandit` pass cleanly.
- The `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` file now reflects that Phase 2 tasks are complete, matching the board status.

Overall, the implementation meets the sprint objectives and passes all automated checks. Future improvements could focus on trimming example code from modules and enhancing documentation.
