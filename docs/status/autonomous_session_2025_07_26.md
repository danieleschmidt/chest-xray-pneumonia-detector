### ðŸ“Š WSJF Scoring Applied
```
WSJF = (Business Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction) / Job Size

Cryptography: (9 + 9 + 10) / 2 = 14.0 ðŸš¨ CRITICAL
Gunicorn:     (8 + 8 + 9)  / 2 = 12.5 ðŸš¨ CRITICAL  
MLflow:       (7 + 7 + 8)  / 3 = 7.33 ðŸš¨ HIGH
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Security Audit Process
1. **Dependency Analysis**: pip-audit scan identified 5 vulnerabilities in 3 packages
2. **Risk Assessment**: CVSS scoring and impact analysis for medical AI context
3. **Prioritization**: WSJF methodology applied with security multipliers
4. **Execution**: Sequential dependency upgrades with compatibility verification
5. **Verification**: Post-fix security audit confirms zero vulnerabilities
