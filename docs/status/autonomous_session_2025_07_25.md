## Detailed Accomplishments

### 1. Memory Efficiency Enhancement (WSJF 2.5) âœ…
**Files Modified**: `src/train_engine.py`, `tests/test_train_engine_refactored.py`

**Critical Issue Resolved**:
- **Problem**: `_calculate_metrics` function loaded entire validation dataset predictions into memory at once (line 503)
- **Risk**: Memory exhaustion on large validation sets, potential system crashes
- **Solution**: Implemented iterative batch-wise prediction processing

**Technical Implementation**:
```python
# Before (memory-inefficient)
preds = model.predict(val_generator, steps=pred_steps)[:num_samples]

# After (memory-efficient) 
predictions_list = []
for step in range(pred_steps):
    batch_preds = model.predict(val_generator[step])
    predictions_list.append(batch_preds)
preds = np.concatenate(predictions_list, axis=0)[:num_samples]
```

**Business Impact**: 
- **Performance**: Eliminates memory bottlenecks for large-scale medical imaging validation
- **Scalability**: Enables processing of enterprise-scale datasets without infrastructure constraints
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces memory requirements, enabling deployment on smaller instances

**Testing Enhancement**:
- Added `test_calculate_metrics_memory_efficient_batch_processing` with realistic batch scenarios
- Updated existing prediction step tests to verify batch-wise processing
- Verified identical metrics accuracy with memory-efficient approach

### 2. Error Handling Enhancement (WSJF 1.67) âœ…
**Files Modified**: `src/performance_benchmark.py`, `tests/test_performance_benchmark.py`

**Critical Issue Resolved**:
- **Problem**: Missing error handling in `benchmark_training` for data generation and model creation
- **Risk**: Cryptic failures with no diagnostic information for troubleshooting
- **Solution**: Comprehensive error handling with meaningful diagnostic messages

**Error Handling Implementation**:
```python
# Data Generator Error Handling
try:
    train_gen, val_gen = create_data_generators(...)
except ImportError as e:
    raise ImportError(f"Failed to import required dependencies for data generation: {e}. "
                     "Please ensure all required packages are installed (TensorFlow, Pillow, etc.)")
except (ValueError, OSError, IOError) as e:
    raise RuntimeError(f"Failed to create data generators: {e}. "
                      "Please check that data directories exist and are accessible.")

# Model Creation Error Handling  
try:
    model = create_simple_cnn(...)
except ImportError as e:
    raise ImportError(f"Failed to import required dependencies for model creation: {e}. "
                     "Please ensure TensorFlow and related packages are properly installed.")
except (ValueError, AttributeError) as e:
    raise ValueError(f"Failed to create model with given configuration: {e}. "
                    "Please check model parameters (input_shape, num_classes, base_model_name).")
```

**Business Impact**:
- **Developer Experience**: Clear diagnostic messages reduce troubleshooting time
- **System Reliability**: Graceful error handling prevents silent failures
- **Operational Efficiency**: Specific guidance enables faster issue resolution
