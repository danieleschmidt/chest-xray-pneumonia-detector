# Project Charter: Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Detector

## Executive Summary

The Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Detector project aims to develop a robust, production-ready machine learning system for automated pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images. This project addresses the critical healthcare challenge of rapid and accurate pneumonia diagnosis, potentially improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.
