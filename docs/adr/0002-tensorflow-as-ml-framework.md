# ADR-0002: TensorFlow as Primary ML Framework

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The project requires a robust machine learning framework for developing, training, and deploying CNN models for pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images. We need to choose between major frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and others.

## Decision
We will use TensorFlow 2.17+ with Keras as the primary machine learning framework for this project.

## Reasoning
- **Medical AI Ecosystem**: TensorFlow has strong support in medical AI applications
- **Production Deployment**: TensorFlow Serving provides robust model serving capabilities
- **Model Optimization**: TensorFlow Lite for potential mobile/edge deployment
- **Community Support**: Large community and extensive documentation
- **Transfer Learning**: Excellent pre-trained models available (ImageNet, etc.)
- **Healthcare Compliance**: Better tooling for model validation and compliance

## Alternatives Considered
- **PyTorch**: More research-friendly but less mature deployment ecosystem
- **JAX**: Cutting-edge but less stable for production use
- **Scikit-learn**: Too limited for deep learning applications

## Consequences

### Positive
- Access to TensorFlow Hub for pre-trained models
- Strong ecosystem for medical imaging (TensorFlow Medical Imaging)
- Robust deployment options with TensorFlow Serving
- Better support for model optimization and quantization
- Mature MLOps tools integration

### Negative
- Steeper learning curve compared to PyTorch for some team members
- Less flexibility for research and experimentation
- Larger model sizes compared to some alternatives
- More complex debugging compared to PyTorch's dynamic graphs

## Implementation Notes
- Use Keras functional API for complex model architectures
- Leverage tf.data for efficient data pipelines
- Implement model checkpointing and versioning with MLflow
- Use TensorBoard for training visualization and debugging
