# ADR-0003: FastAPI for Model Serving API

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a web framework to expose our trained pneumonia detection models via RESTful APIs. The API must support high-performance inference, proper error handling, authentication, and comprehensive documentation for medical applications.

## Decision
We will use FastAPI as the primary web framework for model serving APIs.

## Reasoning
- **Performance**: Excellent performance with async support
- **Type Safety**: Built-in Pydantic integration for request/response validation
- **Documentation**: Automatic OpenAPI/Swagger documentation generation
- **Medical Compliance**: Strong validation capabilities for healthcare data
- **Modern Python**: Full support for Python 3.8+ type hints
- **Testing**: Excellent testing support with built-in test client

## Alternatives Considered
- **Flask**: Simpler but requires more boilerplate for validation and docs
- **Django REST Framework**: Overkill for our API-focused use case
- **TensorFlow Serving**: Limited flexibility for custom business logic

## Consequences

### Positive
- Automatic API documentation for medical staff and developers
- Strong type validation prevents errors with medical data
- High performance for inference workloads
- Easy integration with authentication and monitoring
- Built-in support for async operations

### Negative
- Newer framework with smaller ecosystem compared to Flask
- Learning curve for teams familiar with Flask/Django
- May be overkill for simple use cases

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use Pydantic models for all request/response schemas
- Implement proper error handling for medical data validation
- Add comprehensive logging for audit trails
- Include health check endpoints for monitoring
- Implement rate limiting for production deployment
