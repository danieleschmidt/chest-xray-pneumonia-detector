# ADR-0001: Architecture Decision Record Format

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a standardized format for documenting architectural decisions in the Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Detector project. This will help maintain a clear record of important technical decisions, their context, and rationale.

## Decision
We will use the Architecture Decision Record (ADR) format to document significant architectural and technical decisions. Each ADR will follow this structure:

- **Title**: Brief description of the decision
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context**: The situation that motivates this decision
- **Decision**: The change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or more difficult as a result

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear documentation of architectural decisions
- Historical context for future team members
- Improved decision-making process through explicit documentation
- Better understanding of system evolution over time

### Negative
- Additional overhead in documenting decisions
- Requires discipline to maintain and update records
- May slow down rapid prototyping phases
