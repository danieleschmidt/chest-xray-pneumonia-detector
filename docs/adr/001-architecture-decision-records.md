# ADR-001: Architecture Decision Records

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-27  
**Deciders**: Development Team  

## Context

We need a systematic way to document significant architectural decisions made during the development of the Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Detector project. This will help team members understand the reasoning behind technical choices and provide historical context for future decisions.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions. ADRs will be stored in the `docs/adr/` directory and numbered sequentially.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved documentation of architectural decisions
- Better knowledge sharing among team members
- Historical context for future architectural changes
- Transparency in decision-making process

### Negative
- Additional overhead for documenting decisions
- Requires discipline to maintain consistently

## Template

Future ADRs will follow this template:

```markdown
